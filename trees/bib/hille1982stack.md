An isomorphism between stack permutations of a set of $n$ elements and ordered binary trees with $n$ vertices is presented. which allows the construction of simple linear time algorithms to compute a ranking function and its inverse for binary trees. No pre-processing of tables is required, as was the case with previously published methods.
