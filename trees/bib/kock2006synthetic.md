The aim of the present book is to describe a foundation for 
synthetic reasoning in differential geometry. 
We hope that such a foundational treatise will put the reader in a position 
where he, in his study of differential geometry, can utilize 
the synthetic method freely and rigorously, and that it will give him notions 
and language by which such study can be communicated.
