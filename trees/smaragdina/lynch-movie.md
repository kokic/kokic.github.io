> I think I love ideas. I like a story that's got some concrete <hint>you know</hint> structure but also holds abstractions. Life is filled with abstractions and the way we make heads tails of it is through intuition. And so people get used to film that pretty much explains itself a hundred percent. And they kind of turn off that you know beautiful thing of intuition when they're looking at a film that has some abstractions. And some people on the other hand love these abstractions. <light>And it gives them room to dream.</light> 

> A abstractions to me is a thing that cinema can say. And it' so beautiful for me anyway to think about these pictures and some sounds flowing along together in the time in a sequence making a thing that can only really be said in cinema. It's not words. It's not just music. It's the whole bunch of things coming together and making a thing that didn't exist before. And that's what i really love about it. 

> And then to answer your question a little further. It's up to the people <hint>you know</hint> to <hint>you know</hint> find their own <hint>your know</hint> interpretation. It's doesn't really matter what I think. It's all every screening no matter what even if all the frames of the film are exactly the same. But there no two screenings that are exactly the same. <light>It's the viwer and the picture and the sound and it makes a circle and it just goes like that.</light> And so you just feel it and think it. That's kind of intuition emotion and thinking together and come up make it have a sense to you.

译: 我想我钟爱的是理念本身. 我喜欢那种既有具象结构又蕴含抽象思维的故事. 生活本就充满抽象, 而我们理解它的方式就是通过直觉. 人们已经习惯了那些将一切解释得明明白白的电影, 当看到带有抽象元素的影片时, 他们往往会关闭那种美妙的直觉感知. 而另一些人却恰恰痴迷这种抽象, <light>因为这给了他们造梦的空间. </light> 

对我而言, 抽象正是电影独有的表达方式. 当画面与声音在流动的时间中交织, 形成唯有电影才能言说的意境 $—$ 这不是文字能描述的, 也不仅是音乐能呈现的, 而是所有元素共同创造出前所未有的存在 $—$ 这种构想本身就已美得令人心醉. 

进一步回答你的问题: 观众完全可以根据自己的理解来诠释作品. 我的想法其实无关紧要. 每一次放映都是独特的相遇, 即便胶片帧数分毫不差, 但银幕光影与观者感受却不可重现. <light>这种循环生生不息, </light> 你只需去感受, 去思考, 让直觉情感与理性交融, 最终形成属于你自己的体验.
