A reference GitHub Workflow configuration can be found [here](/tutorials/workflow-yml.md) [^hongjr03-workflow]. The only thing to note is the environment variable `$PAGE_URL`, which is used to [specify the URL of the page to be deployed](/tutorials/compile-en-US). You can set [these](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables) in the `settings/variables/actions` section of your repository.
