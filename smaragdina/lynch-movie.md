> I think I love ideas. I like a story that's got some concrete <hint>you know</hint> structure but also holds abstractions. Life is filled with abstractions and the way we make heads tails of it is through intuition. And so people get used to film that pretty much explains itself a hundred percent. And they kind of turn off that you know beautiful thing of intuition when they're looking at a film that has some abstractions. And some people on the other hand love these abstractions. <light>And it gives them room to dream.</light> A abstractions to me is a thing that cinema can say. And it' so beautiful for me anyway to think about these pictures and some sounds flowing along together in the time in a sequence making a thing that can only really be said in cinema. It's not words. It's not just music. It's the whole bunch of things coming together and making a thing that didn't exist before. And that's what i really love about it. And then to answer your question a little further. It's up to the people <hint>you know</hint> to <hint>you know</hint> find their own <hint>your know</hint> interpretation. It's doesn't really matter what I think. It's all every screening no matter what even if all the frames of the film are exactly the same. But there no two screenings that are exactly the same. <light>It's the viwer and the picture and the sound and it makes a circle and it just goes like that.</light> And so you just feel it and think it. That's kind of intuition emotion and thinking together and come up make it have a sense to you.
